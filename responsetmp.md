Sammanfattning på svenska:
I det här avsnittet av Datastudion diskuterar Hugo och Benny vad som utgör en "modern data platform," eller modern data stack, och varför det är viktigt. De pratar om hur dessa plattformar är molnbaserade och består av olika verktyg som hanterar insamling, bearbetning, lagring och analys av data. Fördelarna med en modern dataplattform inkluderar enkel skalbarhet, användarvänlighet, och förmågan att enkelt byta ut verktyg när bättre alternativ dyker upp.

De lyfter också fram att moderna dataplattformar ofta är byggda med mjukvaruutvecklares behov i åtanke, vilket inkluderar versionhantering och automatisering. Benny och Hugo reflekterar också över att det kan vara lättare för en modern mjukvaruutvecklare att bli dataingenjör jämfört med en traditionell databasadministratör, tack vare dessa moderna verktyg.

De avslutar med att konstatera att det som kallas "modern dataplattform" kanske inte längre är så modernt, utan snarare en standard för analysplattformar idag. De ser fram emot framtida trender som AI, som kan påverka hur dataplattformar utvecklas.
